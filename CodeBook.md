### Data Set Information
The research was conducted with a cohort of 30 participants aged between 19 and 48 years. Each individual engaged in six distinct activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING), while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) attached to their waist. By utilizing the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a consistent rate of 50Hz. To annotate the data, the experiments were video-recorded. The acquired dataset was randomly divided into two subsets, with 70% of the participants contributing to the training data and the remaining 30% to the testing data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) underwent preprocessing through noise filters. These signals were then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows, each lasting 2.56 seconds, with a 50% overlap (128 readings per window). The accelerometer's signal, which comprises components related to gravitational and body motion, was isolated using a Butterworth low-pass filter, thus segregating body acceleration from gravity. Given that the gravitational force predominantly possesses low-frequency characteristics, a filter with a 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was employed. Consequently, from each window, a feature vector was extracted by computing variables derived from the time and frequency domains.

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
## Identifiers
